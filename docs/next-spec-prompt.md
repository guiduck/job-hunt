speckit.specify

## Candidate Feature
Full-time LinkedIn Jobs External Search Manual Validation Follow-up

## Context
Spec 018 has its automated implementation complete. The next product/spec decision should be based on manual LinkedIn smoke results: direct Jobs URL behavior without geoId, whether geoId is needed, whether fallback click-path is required, whether assisted entry is reliable, and whether diagnostics/counters match real mixed cards.

## Prompt
Create the next spec only after manual smoke observations are recorded. If LinkedIn Jobs external search works reliably, specify polishing/history drilldown for external runs. If direct URL or DOM inspection is fragile, specify hardening for LinkedIn Jobs navigation selectors, fallback click-path, and operator recovery controls. Keep `apps/web`/Freelance out of scope.
