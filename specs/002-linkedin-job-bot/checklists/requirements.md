## Notes

- Validation passed in the initial iteration.
- The spec intentionally frames the local database requirement as a repeatable local data foundation, preserving the user's Docker-local intent while keeping the specification focused on outcomes rather than implementation mechanics.
- The LinkedIn job bot is scoped as a skeleton and validation path only; full scraping scale, email sending, resume parsing, AI ranking, UI, and freelance prospecting remain out of scope.
